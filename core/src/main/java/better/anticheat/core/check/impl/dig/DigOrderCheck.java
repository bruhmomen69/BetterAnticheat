         *
         * Start -> Stop -> Stop -> Stop -> Stop -> Stop
         *
         * This occurs when you break a block in a WorldGuard area with a block behind it. For some reason after
         * finishing breaking the block, when the block is replaced it is assumed that the Dig process is still
         * continuing. I'm really not sure why it works like this, but it means we can no longer check for repeated
         * finish actions. It also means the following is valid netcode:
         *
         * Start -> Stop -> Cancel
         *
         * Since the player is still continuing digging after finishing!!! I give up Mojang.
