         * In Minecraft networking, certain packets are sent at certain stages of the tick. The two most important are
         * the Flying packet (Flying, Position, Rotation, and Position and Rotation) and the End Tick packet. The flying
         * packet and its subtypes are sent near the end of the tick, while the End Tick packet is sent at the absolute
         * end of the tick. Thus, we can check if various types of packets are sent between the Flying and End Tick
         * packet when they should be sent earlier in the tick. This can be indicative of a cheat artificially sending
         * packets when it shouldn't be.
         *
         * This also includes a patch for the change slot packet where the first one may be sent out of order.
