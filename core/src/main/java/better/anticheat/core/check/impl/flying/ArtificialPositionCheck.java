         * In the anticheat community, a common term you likely would have heard a few years back was "0.03". This is a
         * reference to a line of code in Minecraft that attempted to reduce the amount of packets sent to servers (and
         * thus bandwidth usage) by not sending arbitrarily small movements. The following is a recreation of that line:
         *
         * bool canSend = (deltaX * deltaX + deltaY * deltaY + deltaZ * deltaZ) > 0.0009
         *
         * This created a lot of issues for anticheats, though, as many movement checks are based on the movement in the
         * prior tick (Minecraft's movement works this way for applying gravity, friction, and other forces) and you may
         * have missed out on seeing what that movement was in the prior tick. The name "0.03" stuck for this issue as
         * if any one of the deltaX, deltaY, or deltaZ values were 0.03 and the others were 0 it would trigger.
         *
         * Today, the issue is not as prevalent for a few reasons:
         * 1. The client now sends its movement inputs, making movement predictions a lot easier.
         * 2. We now have an accurate indication of client ticking (the tick end packet), making it easy to identify
         * what ticks 0.03 is occurring (whenever a position isn't sent between tick end packets).
         * 3. The 0.0009 value was changed to 4.0E-8D (double representation in Java) in 1.18.2.
         *
         * I still have the opinion that this threshold should be set to 0 (no movement), but oh well! This is good
         * enough for now I guess.
         *
         * Anyway, this check is designed to abuse that. We know a position cannot be sent under this threshold unless
         * 20 ticks have passed without a position (see FlyingSequenceCheck), so we can verify that there is not more
         * than one movement under this threshold within a one-second span. This can help identify when cheats may fake
         * movements as many do not account for this threshold.
