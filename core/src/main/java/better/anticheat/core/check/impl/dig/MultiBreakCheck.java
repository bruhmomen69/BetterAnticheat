         * This check patches a very interesting bypass mechanic in some cheats.
         *
         * Some clients bypass classic fast break checks by following this process:
         * Start1 -> Start2 -> Finish1 -> Start3 -> Finish2 -> Start4 -> etc
         *
         * It starts digging multiple blocks at the same time, waiting until the proper time has passed to finish any.
         * This also isn't easily detectable by checking if the last action and current action are starts because the
         * vanilla client does that when breaking insta-break blocks. This doesn't seem to be as common anymore, but I'm
         * still including it regardless.
         *
         * Interesting note for 1.21+! I've noticed behavior where if a block is next to an insta-break block in a
         * WorldGuard protected area, you can mine the block through the insta-break. The client will only ever Start
         * digging the insta-break, but will finish the other block.
