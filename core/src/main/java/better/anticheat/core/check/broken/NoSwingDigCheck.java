         *
         * It is entirely stable, except for one very specific scenario!
         *
         * Currently, it is not stable due to some really weird behavior with world borders.
         * If you start digging a block near the world border and then adjust your view to look at the blue barrier, you
         * can enter a state where your latest digging status is still start, but you are no longer swinging. You can
         * then either let go and have this check flag via the Cancel action or return to the block and have it flag via
         * the Finished action.
         *
         * Potential ideas for fixing this revolve around compensating the world and checking for proximity to the world
         * border.
