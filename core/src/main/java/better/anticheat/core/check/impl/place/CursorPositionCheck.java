         * This raycast must stay within of the bounds of 0 <= i <= 1, with i representing the raycast value. This means
         * that values below 0 or above 1 are invalid. While largely patched today, a large issue with cheats in the
         * past was that they would artificially place blocks in spots that they cannot see and then still perform the
         * required raycast, essentially reporting on themselves that they weren't actually able to see the block that
         * they placed.
