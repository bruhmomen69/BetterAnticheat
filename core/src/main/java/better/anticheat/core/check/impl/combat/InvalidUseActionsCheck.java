         * In Minecraft, a pretty general rule is that you can't attack entities while using an item (pulling back a
         * bow, eating food, blocking a shield, etc). This sounds extremely simple to detect, until you start looking
         * into Minecraft's netcode. When using certain consumables like enderpearls, you send an initial use but never
         * release. This means that just because a player started using an item doesn't mean they're going to actually
         * be using it. So, we only know they were actually using an item when they release it. So our check likes this:
         * 1. We listen for an initial use item packet and start tracking at that point.
         * 2. We listen for action packets like block placements and attacks.
         * 3. On release, we see if they performed any actions and flag them if they did.
